## Get Started Developing ##

Clone this repository, create a feature branch, r, etc.. 

pull request remove the remote branch from the repository once it is merged ?

## Code Integration Workflow ##

It's a good idea to outline your development process, as it may change from project to project. Do you want people to fork your repository and send pull requests; create feature branches and send pull requests; or just go ahead and commit to master? Let the developers know up-front, so there's no confusion.

## Environments ##

Outline information for your dev, staging and live environments, if you have them. Also, outline the process for getting things to the various places. How do I make sure my code is on staging? What is the best way to grab a database dump? We like to setup drush aliases for each environment ahead of time as a means of outlining this information and giving developers a good starting point. This document contains some example commands for doing some typical operations. Here's an example.

## Links to where to find more information ##

wiki? 
where we keep more detailed documentation and notes on things; project details like the original proposal's SOW, credentials to environments, Scrum Notes, Pre-launch checklists, etc.



##### Using Git #####
Clone into `https://github.com/ngi-automation/truseq-nano.git` from the `Protocol Files` directory:

```bash
cd "C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files"
git clone https://github.com/ngi-automation/truseq-nano.git
```

Alternatively, download the compressed folder from:
[`https://github.com/KapaAutpmation/archive/master.zip`][zip]
and extract to `C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files`. Rename the resulting `master` folder to ``. The path to the folder containing the extracted files should then be '`.
